# Prisma Cloud Ultimate Test Drive (UTD) Workshop
## Assignment 1.0
### Prisma Cloud Login Setup
As part of the lab, each individual participant is being provided with their own Prisma Cloud account.
This account will be active for the duration of the lab and will have read-only access and does not
have full access to the Prisma Cloud Service and access to some functions is denied. This account
cannot make changes to the configuration of the associated Prisma Cloud Services. For this reason,
we have provided a lab email address and that email address is used to login to Prisma Cloud.

In this activity, you will:
* Setup login to Prisma Cloud Enterprise Edition Console
